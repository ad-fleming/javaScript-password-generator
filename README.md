# javaScript-password-generator

## Goals and Challenges

This project was designed to challenge us to add logic to a website so that randomly generated passwords display based on prompts and confirmations directed at the user. It challenged us to implement javaScript techniques which we learned in class. 

In my case, I wanted to learn to incorporate arrays and objects, which brought some additional challenges. In addition to writing functions to incorporate the prompt and confirm data, I created an object where character code arrays were stored in a separate array. This resulted in a two-dimensional array which required a unique solution to creating the generated password.

You will see that altogether, this particular solution is probably not the most efficient or direct, but focuses on exploring how to use some of the tools and methods that will become essential as we tackle more difficult problems.

Take a look below to see our guidelines!

## User Story

1.AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
1.I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
1.SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security


## Acceptance Criteria

1.GIVEN I need a new, secure password
1.WHEN I click the button to generate a password
1.THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
1.WHEN prompted for password criteria
1.THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
1.WHEN prompted for the length of the password
1.THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 
characters
1.WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
1.THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
1.WHEN I answer each prompt
1.THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
1.WHEN all prompts are answered
1.THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
1.WHEN the password is generated
1.THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
